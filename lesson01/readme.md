# Simulations and Optimizations
## Lesson 1
To run the simulation once and see the logs of arrival and departure run:
```
python3 sim1.py
python3 sim2.py
```
To run multiple tests and get the statistics run:
```
python3 sim1.py n_tests
python3 sim2.py n_tests
```
After this a folder named stats containing each individual simulation states is created!
Finally run:
```
python3 stats.py n_tests
```
